Bandit LOVES tomatoes. In his ten years, the only time that he's ever gotten into the trash can was to go after some especially yummy salsa. Luckily for Bandit, we're planting a ton of tomatoes this year... and, thanks to the Mother Earth News magazine from my Mom, we'll know how to make those tomatoes turn out great!

As you can see, Bandit is intently reading up to make sure we don't make any mistakes. And, it looks like he can already imagine tasting those awesome cherry tomatoes that we're going to grow for him.\
