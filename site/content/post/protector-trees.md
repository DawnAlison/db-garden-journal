  Planting trees to attract birds away from your other fruit trees. Give them
  something better to eat than what you want to eat.

Today, while reading Stark Bros blog, I learned about protector trees in regards to fruit trees. It's a tree you plant that is the most attractive to birds so they go after it rather than your other fruit trees. It basically helps keep them from eating up all the stuff you want for yourself. They said the best tree for this is the Mulberry Tree! Take a look at ~~their article~~ (article has been removed) to learn more. I'm definitely planting one of these when we plant other fruit trees!\
